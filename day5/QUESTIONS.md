# Questions day 5

# Question 1
No there is no such thing as a stable heap, it is a run time memory. We have to use stable memory
# Question 2 
Depends on the if A & B & C are on the same subnet or not. So basically there are multiples cases
All on the same subnet => 1+1=2 rounds of consensus. Time 2+2 = 4 seconds
All on different subnets => 2+2=4 rounds of consensus Time 4+4 = 8 seconds
One of them is on a different subnet => 1+2= 3 rounds of consensus Time 2+4 = 6 seconds
# Question 3
No, source : learned the hard way.
